------------

Born in Avila, with Salamanca in the heart and now in Bilbao.  
I love the blue color and the strongly typed languages (although I'm taking off), also, I enjoy learning new things and although it surprises ... I like to document !!  
I am not afraid of technological challenges, in fact, without those challenges life is a bit more boring. My last years have been oriented to the development of mobile operating systems, but who said fear?  
I once tried to be an Instagrammer with my food 👨🏻‍🍳
